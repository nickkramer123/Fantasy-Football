
My program is a fantasy football draft created in c++. When the program is ran,
it first asks you the number of people participating in the draft, between 1 and 16.
After this, the participants take turns selecting players from the board. Once
selected, no other team can have that player. The board displays the 5 highest
players still left on the board.

My latest change was to add different positions to my draft. I created the
quarterback, running back, and wide recevier classes, and made them children of the players
class. I also created a testing suite to make sure my file input and class functions work
properly.

Future work:
I was able to complete my most important change of adding different positions.
However, I am currently working on a video-game like frontend for my program
using a graphics module. It will be placed in a different repository once
finished.
