My program is a fantasy football draft. When the program is ran, it first asks
you the number of people participating in the draft, between 1 and 16. After this,
the participants take turns selecting players from the board. Once selected, no
other team can have that player. The board displays the 5 highest players still
left on the board.

In Module 2, my main change was to add different positions to my draft. I created the
quarterback, running back, and wide recevier classes, and made them children of the players
class. I also created a testing suite to make sure my file input and class functions work
properly.

Summary of Module 1 concepts used:
Class seperated into header and .cpp files, for both the draft and players classes
Overloaded operators and stream insertion operator in players class

Summary of Module 2 concepts used:
Testing program
Is-A class relationship: quarterback, runningback and widereciever are  players
File input and output: List of quarterbacks, runningbacks, widerecievers read in for each class

Future work:
This module I was able to complete my most important change of adding different positions.
However, I still plan on doing a lot of future work on this project. There is a lot of
functionality that I have not had the time to add yet that are essential to a fantasy football
draft. For example, I want to add a snake draft system, more ability to display stats, 
and a limit on the number of players per position that you can take. I am not sure
what I am going to do next module, maybe some sort of frontend.

There are no known bugs at the time of submission.

Based on the work submitted, I feel I deserve 90 points for this project. Honestly this seems like a lot
even to me, but based on the rubric this is the grade I deserve. I used many concepts from module 2,
including 3 is-a relationships, albeit they are all very similar. I also feel that my program is well
made, contains no bugs, and is very usable.
